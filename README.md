# docker-windows-pyinstaller
Boilerplate for building a PyInstaller exe in a Windows Docker container.

## Setup
Add project files to `src/`.

From a bash environment, run `build.sh`. If you don't have bash, just open it and execute the docker commands manually.

PyInstaller exe will be copied to `dist/`.
